Description:

This project will delve into several cryptographic methods.
I will implement the cryptographic methods from scratch. My end
goal is to write it from the bottom up, and if the methods are
good enough, I can use them to encrypt files on my local system.

TODO:

-Create a .h file that includes primes calculator and GCF. I need
to find a method to do this while minimizing the amount of memory
and CPU power I am using.

-Implement a 256 bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm.
Test out what is the best number of rounds.

-Implement Data Encryption Standard (DES)

-Implement RSA algorithm.

-Implement Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)
